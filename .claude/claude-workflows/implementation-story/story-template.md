## Quality Checklist

Before implementation, verify:

### Completeness
- [ ] Problem is clear without prior context
- [ ] Magic moment is explicit
- [ ] Scope boundaries are unambiguous
- [ ] All technical decisions are final (no "or" options)

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] File paths are exact and verified
- [ ] Line numbers are current and verified
- [ ] Patterns match existing codebase
- [ ] Integration points are documented
- [ ] No assumptions about non-existent code

### Implementation Readiness
- [ ] A fresh Claude session can start immediately
- [ ] No questions would need to be asked
- [ ] All dependencies are available
- [ ] Test approach is clear

### Testability
- [ ] Every AC has Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Every AC has a test approach
- [ ] Edge cases have expected behaviors
- [ ] Success can be objectively verified
